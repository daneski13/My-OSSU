# My OSSU Computer Science

[![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

This repository contains my OSSU computer science degree progress and plan.

The [OSSU curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) is a complete and self-paced education in computer science that adheres to the [degree requirements](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf) of an undergraduate computer science major. The curriculum uses course materials from top universities worldwide such as MIT and Stanford.

My current plan is outlined below. I will be completing the tools, security, and ethics courses as they seem relevant.

## Deviations from the OSSU curriculum

| Addition/Removal | Course | Reason |
| :--------------: | :----: | :----: |
|Removal| [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/lessons) | Already had some experience with programming languages and some fundamentals. |
| Removal | [Calculus 1A: Differentiation](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.1x+2T2019/about) | Took calculus course at my University, very comfortable with differentiation. |
| Removal | [Introduction to Intellectual Property](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-intellectual-property) | The business law class I took at my University covered this subject. |
| Addition | [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) | Very popular course and is highly regarded as a fast-paced introduction into computer science. |
